To run the application, you must have Node and npm installed. Once these are installed and the repo is cloned, run "npm install" to install all required dependencies. Then run "node app.js" and you will be able to see the app running at localhost:3000.

The app is currently running at [this link](lukedarroughwebdev.xyz).
